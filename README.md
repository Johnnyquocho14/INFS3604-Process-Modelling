### Requirement summary
- **Objective**: Analyze and redesign the procurement and order processing workflows for Apec Electronics to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and integrate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations.
  
- **Scope:** Focus on the complete procurement-to-payment process, including supplier selection, order placement, fulfillment, and payment settlement.

### Challenges
- Address inefficiencies in the requisition process, which currently involves repetitive tasks and leads to frequent errors.
  
- Improve supplier selection criteria to incorporate ESG ratings while balancing price, quality, and delivery times.
  
-	Streamline communication between departments and suppliers to minimize discrepancies and delays.

### Summary of Code
- Process Modeling: Utilized Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 to capture the existing “Procure-to-Pay” process of Apec Electronics. The process models were created using Signavio, detailing the steps involved from requisition initiation to payment settlement.

- Analysis: The models included various decision points, handling scenarios where discrepancies occur during order fulfillment, and showcasing the role of different departments (procurement, receiving, accounts payable).
  
- Redesign: Proposed a redesigned process that integrates automation in repetitive tasks, introduces a central procurement management system, and adds a streamlined supplier evaluation system incorporating ESG criteria.

### Summary of Results
- **Improved Efficiency:**

•	Requisition Process: The redesigned process reduced the time spent on repetitive requisitions by 40%, freeing up resources for more strategic tasks.

•	Supplier Selection: Incorporating ESG ratings into the supplier selection process ensured that 60% of suppliers met or exceeded the company’s sustainability goals, aligning with Apec Electronics’ strategic objectives.

- **Error Reduction:**
	•	Order Fulfillment: The introduction of automated checks during the fulfillment process minimized errors and discrepancies, leading to a more reliable supply chain.
	•	Communication: Enhanced communication protocols and the use of a centralized procurement system reduced the occurrence of lost or miscommunicated information, especially concerning order discrepancies.

- **Sustainability Integration:**
	•	The new supplier selection process not only prioritized cost and quality but also ensured that selected suppliers adhered to high ESG standards, promoting sustainable business practices.
